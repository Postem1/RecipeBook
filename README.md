# Project Name

This project follows a 3-layer agentic architecture.

## Structure

-   `directives/`: Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the agent.
-   `execution/`: Deterministic Python scripts for performing tasks.
-   `.tmp/`: Intermediate files (ignored by git).
-   `AGENTS.md`: Detailed instructions for the AI agent.

## Getting Started

1.  Add your credentials to `.env` (copy from a template if available).
2.  Review `directives/` for available tasks.
